# TARA Data summary
*powered by EukMS*

This folder will contain assorted data and results as they are collected.

Data will constantly be added as it is gathered, but this repository can be assumed to be in a 
presentable state.

### Installation

Plans are to keep this data directory as an interface to visualize data using **StreamLit**.

A `requirements.txt` file is present for easy python virtual environment collection:

```
git clone https://github.com/cjneely10/TARA-Analysis.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Taxonomy

Run the visualizer with the command:

```
streamlit run TARAVisualize/main.py
```
